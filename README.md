The main objective of my project is to help users, especially the visually impaired, by detecting and identifying objects in real time using AI. It provides instant voice feedback about nearby objects. This makes daily activities safer and more accessible.
The model is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which includes over 80 object categories
